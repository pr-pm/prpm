PRPM focuses on managing prompts, rules, agents, and skills. For MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management, we recommend using **Smithery**.

## What are MCP Servers?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers provide specialized capabilities to Claude Code, like:

- 📁 File system operations
- 🗄️ Database queries
- 🔍 Web search
- ☁️ Cloud resource management
- 🎯 Custom tools and APIs

Think of MCP servers as "superpowers" that extend what Claude Code can do.

## Use Smithery for MCP Servers

**[Smithery](https://smithery.ai)** is a package manager specifically for MCP servers, with 2,000+ servers cataloged.

### Install Smithery CLI

```bash
npm install -g @smithery/cli
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Search for MCP servers
smithery search pulumi
smithery search database

# Install an MCP server
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-pulumi

# List installed servers
smithery list

# Browse all servers
smithery search
```

### Why Smithery?

- ✅ **2,000+ MCP servers** - Comprehensive catalog
- ✅ **Easy installation** - One command to install
- ✅ **Automatic configuration** - Sets up Claude Code for you
- ✅ **Client-agnostic** - Works with multiple AI clients
- ✅ **Active development** - Regularly updated

## MCP Servers + PRPM Collections

PRPM collections provide prompts, rules, and agents. MCP servers complement them by providing capabilities:

### Example: Pulumi Development

```bash
# Install Pulumi prompts and rules via PRPM
prpm install collection/pulumi-infrastructure

# Install Pulumi MCP server via Smithery
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-pulumi
```

Now you have:
- **PRPM**: Pulumi best practices, agents, and workflows
- **Smithery**: Live Pulumi state inspection via MCP

### Example: Full-Stack Development

```bash
# Install development prompts via PRPM
prpm install collection/nextjs-pro

# Install useful MCP servers via Smithery
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't PRPM manage MCP servers?">
    PRPM focuses on prompts, rules, agents, and skills. Smithery specializes in MCP servers with 2,000+ servers already cataloged. We recommend using the right tool for each job.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can PRPM collections include MCP servers?">
    Not directly. PRPM collections bundle prompts and agents. For MCP servers, use Smithery. You can use both tools together - PRPM for prompts, Smithery for capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need MCP servers to use PRPM?">
    No! PRPM collections work great on their own. MCP servers are optional enhancements that add extra capabilities to Claude Code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does PRPM work with Smithery?">
    Yes! They're complementary tools. Use PRPM to install prompts/rules/agents, and Smithery to install MCP servers. Both enhance your AI development workflow.
