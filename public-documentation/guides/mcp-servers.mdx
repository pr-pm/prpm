description: 'Using MCP servers with PRPM collections'
---

PRPM focuses on managing prompts, rules, agents, and skills. For MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, use dedicated MCP catalogs and package managers.

## What are MCP Servers?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers provide specialized capabilities to Claude Code and other AI clients, like:

- 📁 File system operations
- 🗄️ Database queries
- 🔍 Web search
- ☁️ Cloud resource management (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- 🎯 Custom tools and APIs
- 🔗 Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc.)

Think of MCP servers as "superpowers" that extend what AI assistants can do.

## MCP Server Catalogs & Managers

Several services catalog and manage MCP servers. Choose based on your needs:

### Package Managers

**[Smithery](https://smithery.ai)** ([CLI](https://github.com/smithery-ai/cli))
- Large catalog of MCP servers
- CLI for installing and managing servers
- Automatic configuration for Claude Code
- Community-driven catalog

```bash
npm install -g @smithery/cli
smithery search database
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

### Directories & Catalogs

**[MCP Server Finder](https://mcpserverfinder.com)**
- Comprehensive directory with detailed profiles
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Compatibility information
- Community reviews and ratings

**[Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)**
- Curated list on GitHub
- Production-ready and experimental servers
- Web-based directory synced with repository
- Community contributions

**[Official MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)**
- Reference implementations by Anthropic
- Servers for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, PostgreSQL, Puppeteer, Stripe
- Playground for testing and debugging

### Integration Platforms

**[Composio](https://composio.dev)** ([Docs](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/mcp-overview))
- Wide range of tool integrations (Gmail, Linear, Slack, etc.)
- Built-in authentication
- MCP SDK for developers
- Pre-built servers for common integrations

**[Microsoft MCP Catalog](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp)**
- Azure MCP Server (Azure services integration)
- Azure AI Foundry MCP Server
- Azure DevOps MCP Server
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Server

## MCP Servers + PRPM Collections

PRPM collections provide prompts, rules, and agents. MCP servers complement them by providing capabilities.

### Example: Pulumi Development

```bash
# Install Pulumi prompts and rules via PRPM
prpm install collection/pulumi-infrastructure

# Install Pulumi MCP server (choose your method)
smithery install @modelcontextprotocol/server-pulumi
# or configure manually from MCP Server Finder
```

Now you have:
- **PRPM**: Pulumi best practices, agents, and workflows
- **MCP Server**: Live Pulumi state inspection

### Example: Full-Stack Development

```bash
# Install development prompts via PRPM
prpm install collection/nextjs-pro

# Install useful MCP servers
# Filesystem access
# Database queries
# Web search
# (Use any catalog/manager above)
```

### Example: Azure Development

```bash
# Install Azure/DevOps prompts via PRPM
prpm install collection/azure-devops

# Install Azure MCP servers from Microsoft
# Azure services integration
# AKS operations
# DevOps automation
```

## Choosing an MCP Solution

Consider these factors:

**For Quick Start:**
- Smithery CLI for automated installation
- MCP Server Finder for guided setup

**For Discovery:**
- Awesome MCP Servers for curated lists
- MCP Server Finder for detailed profiles
- Official MCP Servers for reference implementations

**For Enterprise:**
- Composio for extensive pre-built integrations
- Microsoft MCP Catalog for Azure integration
- Official implementations for production use

**For Specific Needs:**
- Search multiple catalogs
- Check compatibility
- Read community reviews

## Manual Installation

If not using a package manager, MCP servers are configured in Claude Code's config file:

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

```bash Linux
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

```bash Windows
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```
</CodeGroup>

Add MCP server configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace"]
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after configuration changes.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't PRPM manage MCP servers?">
    PRPM focuses on prompts, rules, agents, and skills. Multiple specialized services already catalog thousands of MCP servers. We recommend using dedicated tools for MCP server management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which MCP catalog should I use?">
    It depends on your needs:
    - **Quick automation**: Smithery CLI
    - **Detailed guides**: MCP Server Finder
    - **Curated lists**: Awesome MCP Servers
    - **Pre-built integrations**: Composio
    - **Azure focus**: Microsoft MCP Catalog
    - **Reference code**: Official MCP Servers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can PRPM collections include MCP servers?">
    Not directly. PRPM collections bundle prompts and agents. For MCP servers, use dedicated MCP catalogs. You can use both together - PRPM for prompts, MCP catalogs for capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need MCP servers to use PRPM?">
    No! PRPM collections work great on their own. MCP servers are optional enhancements that add extra capabilities to Claude Code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which AI clients support MCP?">
    MCP is supported by:
    - Claude Code (Claude Desktop)
    - OpenAI ChatGPT Desktop (as of March 2025)
    - Various MCP-compatible clients

    Check each MCP catalog for compatibility information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create my own MCP server?">
    Yes! See the [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for documentation. You can also reference implementations in the [Official MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) repository.
