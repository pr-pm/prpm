## Overview

PRPM Playground lets you test any package with leading AI models (Claude, GPT-4o, and more) directly in your browser or CLI. No installation required—just instant, interactive testing with real models.

## Why Use Playground?

Before Playground, you had to:
1. Install the package
2. Set up your AI environment
3. Create test scenarios
4. Try it with your model
5. Uninstall if it doesn't work

Playground eliminates this friction entirely. Test instantly, compare results, and make informed decisions before installing anything.

## Getting Started

### Web Interface

1. Browse packages at [prpm.dev/search](https://prpm.dev/search)
2. Click **"Test in Playground"** on any package page
3. Enter your test input
4. Get instant results from your chosen AI model

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Single test
prpm playground @user/package-name "your test input"

# Interactive mode (multi-turn conversation)
prpm playground @user/package-name --interactive

# Compare with baseline (test with and without the package)
prpm playground @user/package-name "test input" --compare

# Use a specific model
prpm playground @user/package-name "test input" --model opus
prpm playground @user/package-name "test input" --model gpt-4o
```

## Supported Models

| Model | Best For | Credit Cost |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Claude Sonnet 3.5** | Balanced performance (default) | 2 credits |
| **GPT-4o Mini** | Fast, simple tasks | 1 credit |
| **GPT-4o** | Advanced reasoning | 3 credits |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | Complex tasks | 4 credits |
| **Claude Opus** | Most capable, complex tasks | 7 credits |

<Note>
1 credit = 5,000 tokens (input + output combined)
</Note>

## Credit System

### Free Trial
- **5 free credits** to get started
- No credit card required
- Test immediately after signup

### PRPM+ Subscription
- **100 monthly credits** for $6/month
- Credits roll over (max 200 balance)
- Unused credits expire after 1 month
- Organization members get PRPM+ for $3/month

### Credit Packs
- Buy additional credits that never expire
- **100 credits = $5.00**
- Stack with monthly credits
- Perfect for heavy users

## Advanced Features

### Compare Mode

Compare the same input with and without the package prompt to see the actual value added:

```bash
prpm playground @user/code-reviewer "Review this code" --compare
```

This runs two tests:
1. **With package**: Uses the package's prompt
2. **Without package**: Baseline model with no prompt

Perfect for evaluating if a package actually improves results or is just prompt fluff.

### Interactive Mode

Have multi-turn conversations to stress test packages:

```bash
prpm playground @user/brainstorm-assistant --interactive
```

- Multiple conversation turns
- Context maintained across messages
- Type `exit` or press Ctrl+C to quit
- Great for testing conversational packages

### Model Selection

Choose the right model for your test:

```bash
# Use Claude Opus for complex analysis
prpm playground @user/complex-analyzer "analyze this" --model opus

# Use GPT-4o Mini for simple tests
prpm playground @user/simple-formatter "format this" --model gpt-4o-mini

# Use GPT-4o for advanced reasoning
prpm playground @user/problem-solver "solve this" --model gpt-4o
```

## Custom Prompts (Verified Authors Only)

Custom prompts let verified authors test their own system prompts before publishing as packages. This is the fastest way to iterate on prompts.

### Requirements

To use custom prompts, you must be a verified author:

1. Run `prpm login` and link your GitHub account
2. Complete GitHub OAuth flow
3. You're now verified and can use custom prompts

Check your status: `prpm whoami`

### Why 2x Cost?

Custom prompts cost **2x normal credits** because they don't benefit from prompt caching:
- Published packages cache the system prompt (cheaper follow-ups)
- Custom prompts can change between requests (no caching possible)
- Still cheaper than running your own API keys

### Web UI Usage

1. Go to [prpm.dev/playground](https://prpm.dev/playground)
2. Toggle **"Use Custom Prompt"** (verified authors only)
3. Enter your system prompt (10-50,000 characters)
4. Enter your test input
5. Click **"Run Playground"**

<Tip>
The web UI is great for quick experiments. The CLI is better for rapid iteration on prompt files.
</Tip>

### CLI Usage

#### Option 1: Inline String

```bash
prpm playground --custom "You are a helpful coding assistant" --input "Explain async/await"
```

#### Option 2: From File (Recommended)

```bash
# Create prompt file
cat > my-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
You are a helpful coding assistant that specializes in TypeScript and React.

When answering questions:
1. Be concise and practical
2. Provide code examples when relevant
3. Explain trade-offs and best practices

Always prioritize type safety and clean code.
EOF

# Test it
prpm playground --prompt-file ./my-prompt.txt --input "Explain async/await"
```

#### Interactive Mode

```bash
prpm playground --prompt-file ./my-prompt.txt --interactive
```

### A/B Testing with --compare

The most powerful feature for custom prompts is `--compare` mode. It runs your custom prompt and a baseline (no prompt) side-by-side:

```bash
prpm playground --custom "You are concise. Use 2 sentences max." --input "Explain recursion" --compare
```

**Output:**

```

You can instantly see your prompt made the response 60% shorter.

### File-Based Workflow (Best for Iteration)

This workflow enables 10 iterations in 10 minutes instead of 10 days:

```bash
# 1. Create prompt file
vim security-reviewer.txt

# 2. Test it with compare mode
prpm playground --prompt-file ./security-reviewer.txt \
  --input "const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId" \
  --compare

# 3. See results, tweak prompt

# 4. Test again (up-arrow to repeat command)
# ...iterate until perfect

# 5. Publish as package
prpm publish
```

### Workflow Comparison

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Without PRPM (Editor Reload Cycle)">
    1. Write prompt in `.cursor/rules` or `.claude/skills/`
    2. Reload/restart your editor
    3. Ask AI a test question in your editor
    4. Realize it needs work
    5. Edit the prompt file
    6. Reload/restart editor again
    7. Test again
    8. **Repeat 10x** (lots of reloading, no comparison mode)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="With PRPM but Without Custom Prompts">
    1. Write prompt locally
    2. Create `prpm.json` manifest
    3. Publish package (version 0.0.1)
    4. Test in Playground
    5. Realize it needs work
    6. Edit prompt locally
    7. Bump version (0.0.2) and publish again
    8. Test new version
    9. **Repeat 10x** (versions 0.0.3 through 0.0.12)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="With PRPM + Custom Prompts">
    1. Write prompt in file
    2. `prpm playground --prompt-file ./prompt.txt --input "test" --compare`
    3. Edit prompt
    4. ↑ (up arrow to repeat command)
    5. **Repeat until perfect** (seconds per iteration)
    6. Publish once
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example: Security Code Reviewer

You're building a security-focused code reviewer that catches SQL injection, XSS, and auth bugs without false positives:

```bash
# Test with real vulnerable code
prpm playground --prompt-file ./security-reviewer.txt \
  --input "const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId" \
  --compare
```

The baseline might give generic advice. Your prompt should catch the specific SQL injection vulnerability and suggest parameterized queries.

Iterate until your prompt consistently catches real vulnerabilities without false positives, then publish it.

### Custom Prompt Limits

| Limit | Value | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Min length | 10 chars | Sanity check |
| Max length | 50,000 chars | Avoids token limits |
| Recommended | 500-5,000 chars | Best results, manageable cost |
| Max output | 1,024 tokens | ~750 words |
| Timeout | 30 seconds | Prevents runaway requests |
| Cost | 2x normal | No caching |

<Warning>
Custom prompts run in isolated sandboxes (text-only, no tools). This is by design for safe experimentation.
</Warning>

### Best Practices for Custom Prompts

1. **Start simple** - Write 2-3 sentences, test, iterate
2. **Use files** - Version control your prompts
3. **Compare early** - Use `--compare` to ensure you're adding value
4. **Test multiple inputs** - Don't optimize for one example
5. **Check token usage** - Long prompts = high costs
6. **Be specific** - "Review for security issues" beats "Review code"
7. **Iterate rapidly** - Edit file → ↑ (repeat command) → see results

## Sharing Results

### Web Interface
1. Complete a test in the playground
2. Click the **"Share"** button
3. Get a shareable link
4. Share with your team or the community

Shared results include:
- The input you tested
- The model's complete response
- Token usage and credit cost
- Package information

### Community Results

Every package page shows recent community test results. See:
- What inputs others tested
- Which models they chose
- Whether they found it helpful
- Token usage and costs

This creates living documentation showing real-world usage.

## For Package Authors

### Analytics Dashboard

Package authors get detailed analytics showing:
- Total test sessions
- Popular AI models used
- Credit usage patterns
- Session duration averages
- Test input trends

Access your analytics at [prpm.dev/dashboard](https://prpm.dev/dashboard)

### Suggested Test Inputs

Help users test your package effectively:

```bash
# Add suggested inputs to your package
prpm suggested-inputs add @user/package-name "Review this authentication code"
prpm suggested-inputs add @user/package-name "Find security vulnerabilities"

# List current inputs
prpm suggested-inputs list @user/package-name

# Remove an input
prpm suggested-inputs remove @user/package-name <input-id>
```

Suggested inputs appear automatically in the playground, making it easier for users to test your package with relevant examples.

## Pricing & Limits

### Credit Costs

Credits are spent based on token usage:
- 1 credit = 5,000 tokens
- Tokens = input tokens + output tokens
- Cost shown after each test

### Rate Limits

- **Free tier**: 5 credits total
- **PRPM+**: 100 credits/month + rollover (max 200)
- **Credit packs**: No limits, never expire

### Fair Use

Playground is for testing packages, not production AI usage:
- ✅ Testing packages before installing
- ✅ Comparing multiple packages
- ✅ Sharing test results with team
- ❌ Using as primary AI interface
- ❌ Automating bulk requests
- ❌ Sharing account credentials

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient credits"

**Solution:** Subscribe to PRPM+ or buy a credit pack:
```bash
prpm subscribe
# or
prpm buy-credits
```

### "Package not found"

**Solution:** Verify the package name is correct:
```bash
prpm search "package name"
```

### CLI playground not working

**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in:
```bash
prpm login
prpm playground @user/package "test"
```

### Test taking too long

**Solution:**
- Try a faster model (GPT-4o Mini)
- Reduce input length
- Check your internet connection
