PRPM now supports the **OpenSkills** format, allowing you to publish and install packages compatible with the [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) universal skills loader.

## What is OpenSkills?

OpenSkills is a universal skills loader for AI coding agents that replicates Anthropic's Claude Code skills system across multiple AI platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider).

**Key Features:**
- Universal SKILL.md format
- Works across multiple AI editors
- Progressive skill disclosure
- CLI-based skill management

## Installing OpenSkills Packages

Install any OpenSkills-compatible package from PRPM:

```bash
# Install as OpenSkills format
prpm install @user/python-expert --as openskills

# Installs to: .claude/skills/python-expert/SKILL.md
```

PRPM automatically places OpenSkills packages in `.claude/skills/{package-name}/SKILL.md`, following OpenSkills conventions.

## Publishing OpenSkills Packages

### 1. Create SKILL.md

Create a skill using OpenSkills format:

```markdown
---
name: python-expert
description: Expert Python development guidance with best practices
---

# Python Expert

This skill provides comprehensive Python development guidance.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Writing Python code
- Debugging Python issues
- Optimizing Python performance

## Instructions

To write idiomatic Python:

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Use type hints for function signatures
3. Prefer list comprehensions over loops
4. Use context managers for resource management

## Best Practices

- Write in imperative form: "To do X, execute Y"
- Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words
- Move detailed content to references/ directory
- Use scripts/ for executable code
```

### 2. Create prpm.json

```json
{
  "name": "python-expert",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Expert Python development guidance",
  "format": "openskills",
  "subtype": "skill",
  "author": "your-username",
  "tags": ["python", "development", "best-practices"],
  "files": ["SKILL.md"]
}
```

### 3. Publish

```bash
prpm publish --format openskills
```

## Format Conversion

PRPM can convert between OpenSkills and other formats:

```bash
# Convert Claude skill to OpenSkills
prpm convert my-skill.md --to openskills

# Convert OpenSkills to Cursor
prpm convert SKILL.md --to cursor

# Install OpenSkills package as Cursor format
prpm install @user/python-expert --as cursor
```

### Conversion Quality

**High Quality (95-100%):**
- OpenSkills ↔ Claude Skills (both use similar markdown + frontmatter)
- Instructions, rules, examples convert cleanly

**Lossy Conversions:**
- **Tools** → Converted to markdown section (OpenSkills doesn't have explicit tools support)
- **Persona** → Converted to markdown section (OpenSkills doesn't have persona concept)

## OpenSkills Directory Structure

OpenSkills supports bundled resources:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md               # Main skill instructions
├── references/            # Optional supporting docs
│   └── api-guide.md
├── scripts/               # Optional helper scripts
│   └── setup.sh
└── assets/                # Optional templates/configs
    └── template.py
```

PRPM packages these automatically when you include them in the `files` array:

```json
{
  "files": [
    "SKILL.md",
    "references/api-guide.md",
    "scripts/setup.sh"
  ]
}
```

## OpenSkills vs PRPM Skills

| Feature | OpenSkills | PRPM |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Format** | SKILL.md only | Multiple formats (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, etc.) |
| **Discovery** | GitHub-based | Centralized registry with search |
| **Installation** | CLI tool | CLI + Web UI |
| **Conversion** | Not supported | Auto-converts between all formats |
| **Collections** | Not supported | Bundle multiple packages |
| **Analytics** | No | Downloads, views, trends |

## Using Both Together

OpenSkills and PRPM complement each other:

**OpenSkills** - Universal skills format, multi-platform support
**PRPM** - Discovery, versioning, format conversion, collections

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Publish to PRPM in OpenSkills format
prpm publish --format openskills

# 2. Users discover via PRPM registry
prpm search python

# 3. Install with auto-conversion to their preferred format
prpm install @you/python-expert --as cursor

# 4. Or install in native OpenSkills format
prpm install @you/python-expert --as openskills
```

## Best Practices

### Writing OpenSkills-Compatible Content

1. **Use Imperative Form**
   ```markdown
   ✅ To debug issues, add logging statements
   ❌ You should add logging statements to debug
   ```

2. **Keep Skills Focused**
   - One skill = one domain/capability
   - Under 5,000 words in SKILL.md
   - Move details to references/

3. **Structure Instructions Clearly**
   ```markdown
   ## When to Use
   Load this skill when...

   ## Instructions
   Step-by-step guidance...

   ## Best Practices
   Key principles...
   ```

4. **Include Examples**
   - Show good vs bad examples
   - Provide code snippets
   - Demonstrate common patterns

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I convert existing PRPM packages to OpenSkills?">
    Yes! Use `prpm convert <file> --to openskills` or install with `--as openskills` flag. PRPM automatically converts from any supported format.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are OpenSkills packages installed?">
    PRPM installs OpenSkills packages to `.claude/skills/{package-name}/SKILL.md` following OpenSkills conventions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need OpenSkills CLI to use OpenSkills format in PRPM?">
    No. PRPM has native OpenSkills support built-in. However, you can use both tools together - PRPM for discovery/publishing, OpenSkills CLI for management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's lost when converting to/from OpenSkills?">
    OpenSkills doesn't support:
    - Explicit tools lists (converted to markdown)
    - Persona sections (converted to markdown)
    - Multi-file agents (only SKILL.md supported)

    These limitations result in 85-95% conversion quality scores.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I publish the same package in multiple formats?">
    Yes! Publish once in any format, and PRPM automatically converts to all supported formats on-demand. Users can install in their preferred format.
