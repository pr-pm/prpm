## Overview

Meta packages are **packages that teach AI how to create other packages**. They're "prompts about writing prompts" - expert guidance that helps AI assistants generate high-quality, well-structured PRPM packages.

Think of them as:
- Package creation templates
- Style guides for AI prompts
- Best practices for package structure
- Quality standards enforcement

## Why Meta Packages Matter

AI assistants are great at generating content, but they need guidance to produce **consistently high-quality packages** that follow PRPM conventions.

Without meta packages:
- ❌ Inconsistent package structures
- ❌ Poor CSO (Context Search Optimization)
- ❌ Missing required fields
- ❌ Unclear when to use packages
- ❌ No real-world examples

With meta packages:
- ✅ Standardized structure across all packages
- ✅ Optimized for AI discovery and use
- ✅ Complete metadata and documentation
- ✅ Clear triggering conditions
- ✅ Real examples and patterns

## PRPM's Meta Packages

PRPM uses meta packages to maintain consistency across its own repository. These packages teach AI assistants how to create high-quality packages for each IDE format.

### Format-Specific Creation Packages

PRPM provides specialized packages for creating packages in each supported format. Each format has both a **Claude skill** (for explicit invocation) and a **Cursor rule** (for intelligent context application).

**Quick Reference:**

| Format | Subtype | Claude Skill | Cursor Rule |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Cursor** | Rules | `@prpm/creating-cursor-rules-skill` | `@prpm/creating-cursor-rules` |
| **Cursor** | Commands | `@prpm/creating-cursor-commands-skill` | `@prpm/creating-cursor-commands` |
| **Claude** | Skills | `@prpm/creating-skills-skill` | `@prpm/creating-skills` |
| **Claude** | Agents | `@prpm/creating-claude-agents-skill` | `@prpm/creating-claude-agents` |
| **Claude** | Commands | `@prpm/creating-claude-commands-skill` | `@prpm/creating-claude-commands` |
| **Claude** | Hooks | `@prpm/creating-claude-hooks-skill` | `@prpm/creating-claude-hooks` |
| **Continue** | Rules | `@prpm/creating-continue-packages-skill` | `@prpm/creating-continue-packages` |
| **Windsurf** | Rules | `@prpm/creating-windsurf-packages-skill` | `@prpm/creating-windsurf-packages` |
| **Copilot** | Instructions/Chatmodes | `@prpm/creating-copilot-packages-skill` | `@prpm/creating-copilot-packages` |
| **Kiro** | Steering/Hooks | `@prpm/creating-kiro-packages-skill` | `@prpm/creating-kiro-packages` |

## Creating Your Own Meta Package

### Example: Package Creator for Python

Let's create a meta package that teaches AI to generate Python-specific packages:

```markdown
---
name: python-package-creator
description: Use when creating PRPM packages for Python best practices, frameworks, or libraries
---

# Python Package Creator

## When to Use

Triggers when user says:
- "Create a package for Python {topic}"
- "Generate Python {framework} rules"
- "Package my Python best practices"

## Package Structure Standards

### For Python Skills (Claude)

```markdown
---
name: {framework}-expert
description: Use when working with {framework} - covers common patterns, pitfalls, and best practices
---

# {Framework} Expert

## When to Use

- Starting a new {framework} project
- Debugging {framework} errors
- Optimizing {framework} performance

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: {Real Pattern Name}

**Use case**: [Specific scenario]

**Example**:
```python
# Actual working code
```

**Why it works**: [Explanation]
```

### Required Metadata

Always include:
- `tags`: ["python", "{framework}", "best-practices"]
- `format`: "claude" or "cursor"
- `subtype`: "skill" or "rule"
- Real code examples that actually work

### CSO Optimization

Include searchable keywords:
- Framework names: flask, django, fastapi
- Common errors: "ModuleNotFoundError", "circular import"
- Use cases: "async", "database migrations", "testing"

## Quality Checklist

Before generating, ensure:
- [ ] Real code examples (not pseudocode)
- [ ] Specific error messages mentioned
- [ ] Clear triggering conditions
- [ ] Proper frontmatter
- [ ] Relevant tags

## Example Output

```markdown
---
name: fastapi-expert
description: Use when building FastAPI applications or encountering async route errors
---

# FastAPI Expert

## When to Use

- Building REST APIs with FastAPI
- Debugging async route handlers
- Implementing dependency injection
- Working with Pydantic models

## Common Patterns

### Dependency Injection

**Use case**: Database connections, auth, logging

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
```

**Why it works**: FastAPI calls `get_db()` automatically, handles cleanup
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Generic examples without context
❌ Incomplete code snippets
❌ No explanation of when to use
❌ Missing error messages
❌ Vague descriptions
```

Save as `.claude/skills/python-package-creator/SKILL.md` and publish:

```bash
prpm publish
```

## Real-World Use Case: PRPM's Own Development

PRPM uses meta packages to generate its internal packages. Here's the workflow:

### 1. Install Meta Package
```bash
prpm install @prpm/creating-skills-skill
```

### 2. Create Package
```
User: "Create a skill for Stripe webhook integration"

AI: *references creating-skills-skill*
AI: *generates structured skill with:*
  - Proper frontmatter
  - CSO-optimized description
  - Real webhook code examples
  - Common error solutions
```

### 3. Publish Package
```bash
prpm publish
```

### 4. Share with Community
The generated package is now available in the PRPM registry for others to use.

## Meta Package Patterns

### Pattern 1: Template-Based Generation

Provide a complete template with placeholders:

```markdown
## Template

```markdown
---
name: {{framework}}-{{feature}}
description: Use when {{use_case}}
tags: ["{{framework}}", "{{category}}", "best-practices"]
---

# {{Framework}} {{Feature}}

## When to Use

- {{trigger_condition_1}}
- {{trigger_condition_2}}

## Examples

{{real_code_example}}
```
```

### Pattern 2: Quality Enforcement

Require specific quality standards:

```markdown
## Quality Requirements

Before generating, verify:
1. All code examples are tested and working
2. Error messages are exact (not paraphrased)
3. Framework version is specified
4. At least 3 real-world use cases included
5. Links to official docs provided
```

### Pattern 3: CSO Optimization

Teach AI to optimize for searchability:

```markdown
## CSO Keywords

Include these in description:
- Exact error messages users will search for
- Framework-specific terms
- Common task descriptions
- Integration names

Example:
✅ "Use when getting 'Raw body not available' in Stripe webhooks"
❌ "Use for Stripe integration"
```

### Pattern 4: Format-Specific Guidance

Different AI editors need different formats:

```markdown
## Format Selection

**Cursor (.mdc files)**:
- Use frontmatter with `ruleType`
- Keep concise (Cursor prefers shorter rules)
- Focus on actionable patterns

**Claude (SKILL.md files)**:
- More detailed explanations allowed
- Include "When to Use" section
- Can be longer with examples

**Continue (.continuerc.json)**:
- JSON-based slash commands
- Focus on prompt engineering
- Include system messages
```

## Advanced: Self-Generating Meta Packages

Meta packages can teach AI to create **more meta packages**:

```bash
# Install meta-meta package
prpm install @prpm/meta-package-creator

# Now AI can create packages that teach how to create packages
User: "Create a meta package for Rust best practices"
AI: *generates rust-package-creator that teaches AI how to make Rust packages*
```

This creates a **recursive improvement loop**:
1. Meta package teaches AI to create packages
2. Those packages teach AI domain expertise
3. Domain expertise helps users solve problems
4. Users share new patterns back to packages

## Testing Meta Packages

Before publishing, test that your meta package actually works:

### 1. Install the Meta Package
```bash
prpm install @your-org/python-package-creator
```

### 2. Generate a Package
```
User: "Create a FastAPI authentication package"
AI: *uses python-package-creator guidance*
AI: *generates package*
```

### 3. Verify Output Quality
- [ ] Proper structure and frontmatter
- [ ] Real, working code examples
- [ ] Clear triggering conditions
- [ ] Good CSO keywords
- [ ] Complete metadata

### 4. Iterate
If output is poor, improve the meta package's guidance.

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Complete Templates
Show **exactly** what good packages look like, with all sections filled in.

### 2. Use Real Examples
Don't use placeholder text. Show actual packages from the registry as examples.

### 3. Enforce Standards
Include checklists and requirements that AI must follow.

### 4. Optimize for Discovery
Teach AI to include CSO keywords that users will actually search for.

### 5. Version Your Guidance
As PRPM evolves, update meta packages to reflect new best practices.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Too Abstract
```markdown
"Create a well-structured package with good examples"
```

### ✅ Specific and Actionable
```markdown
"Include frontmatter with name, description, and tags array.
Add 3 code examples with comments.
Ensure description mentions exact error messages."
```

### ❌ Generic Examples
```markdown
"Example: Some code here..."
```

### ✅ Real, Tested Code
```markdown
"Example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    # This pattern avoids N+1 queries
    user = await db.users.find_one({"id": user_id})
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user
```
```

## Publishing Your Meta Package

```bash
# Create prpm.json
{
  "name": "python-package-creator",
  "description": "Meta package for creating high-quality Python PRPM packages",
  "tags": ["meta", "python", "package-creation", "ai-prompts"],
  "format": "claude",
  "subtype": "skill",
  "files": [".claude/skills/python-package-creator/SKILL.md"]
}

# Publish
prpm publish
```
