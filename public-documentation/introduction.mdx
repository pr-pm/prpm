## Quick Example

Install a package:

```bash
prpm install @username/typescript-best-practices
```

Publish your own package:

```bash
prpm init
prpm login
prpm publish
```

## How It Works

PRPM manages AI prompt files across different formats and tools:

1. **Search & Discover** - Find packages in the PRPM registry that match your needs
2. **Install** - Download and install packages to the correct locations (`.cursor/`, `.claude/`, etc.)
3. **Track** - Maintain a lock file (`prpm.lock`) to track what's installed
4. **Update** - Keep your packages up to date with the latest versions
5. **Publish** - Share your own packages with the community

## Supported Formats

PRPM supports a wide range of AI development tools:

- **Cursor** - Rules, agents, slash commands, and tools
- **Claude Code** - Skills, agents, slash commands, hooks, and tools
- **Continue** - Coding rules and prompts
- **Windsurf** - Coding rules, agents, slash commands, and tools
- **GitHub Copilot** - Instructions and chat modes
- **Kiro** - Steering files and hooks
- **Agents.md** - Project context agents
- **MCP** - Model Context Protocol servers
- **Generic** - Universal AI prompts

<Info>
  Each format has its own directory structure and file format. PRPM handles all the details automatically, including format conversion between tools.
