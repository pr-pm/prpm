## Installation

Install the PRPM CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @pr-pm/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
prpm --version
```

<Tip>
  You can also use `npx @pr-pm/cli` to run commands without installing globally.
</Tip>

## Install Your First Package

Search for packages:

```bash
prpm search typescript
```

Install a package (replace with actual package name from search results):

```bash
prpm install cursor-rules/typescript-best-practices
```

<Info>
  Packages are namespaced by author. The format is `author/package-name`.
</Info>

List installed packages:

```bash
prpm list
```

## Discover More Packages

View trending packages:

```bash
prpm trending
```

View most popular packages:

```bash
prpm popular
```

Browse collections (curated package bundles):

```bash
prpm collections --list
```

Install an entire collection:

```bash
prpm collections web-development --install
```

<Info>
  Collections bundle multiple related packages together for easier setup of common stacks and workflows.
</Info>

## Publishing Your First Package

### 1. Initialize a Package

Use the interactive init command to scaffold a new package:

```bash
prpm init
```

This will prompt you for:
- Package name (format: `your-username/package-name`)
- Description
- Format (cursor, claude, windsurf, etc.)
- Subtype (rule, agent, skill, etc.)
- Author information
- License
- Tags

It creates:
- `prpm.json` - Package manifest
- `README.md` - Documentation template
- Example files based on your selected format

### 2. Add Your Content

Edit the generated files with your rules, prompts, or skills:

```bash
# For Cursor rules
vim .cursorrules

# For Claude skills
vim .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Update the README
vim README.md
```

### 3. Login to PRPM

Authenticate with the registry:

```bash
prpm login
```

### 4. Publish

Test your package first (optional but recommended):

```bash
prpm publish --dry-run
```

Then publish for real:

```bash
prpm publish
```

<Success>
  Your package is now live on the PRPM registry! Others can find it with `prpm search` and install it with `prpm install your-username/package-name`.
</Success>

### 5. Update Your Package

When you make changes, increment the version in `prpm.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.1.0"  // Was 1.0.0
}
```

Then publish again:

```bash
prpm publish
```
