## Current Status (as of 2025-01-20)

### ‚úÖ Completed (MVP Features)
- [x] Basic playground functionality (Anthropic + OpenAI)
- [x] Credit system with rollover
- [x] Comparison mode (test 2 prompts side-by-side)
- [x] Database schema with analytics tracking
- [x] Organization-subsidized pricing logic
- [x] Multi-model support (Sonnet, Opus, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo)
- [x] Mobile-responsive UI
- [x] Session management and history
- [x] Stripe integration (purchases + subscriptions)
- [x] Webhook handling for payment events

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Technical Debt
**Before adding new features, address these foundation issues** (see [Foundation Improvements](./08-foundation-improvements.md)):

**Blocking Issues**:
- ‚ùå **Zero test coverage** - No unit or integration tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No error handling** - Credits can be lost on API failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No monitoring** - Can't detect issues in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No rate limiting** - Vulnerable to abuse
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security gaps** - Webhook validation weak

**Performance Issues**:
- No caching (every run queries database)
- No connection pooling for AI APIs
- Sequential database writes (slow)
- Missing composite indexes for analytics

**Recommended**: Allocate 2-3 weeks to fix critical issues before scaling.

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Add test coverage (see 08-foundation-improvements.md)
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Analytics API endpoints (designed, needs implementation)
- [ ] Analytics dashboards (frontend)
- [ ] BuyCreditsModal dynamic pricing display
- [ ] Feedback widget (thumbs up/down)

### üìã Planned (After Foundation Fixed)
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)** - see [Feature Roadmap](./06-feature-roadmap.md):
- [ ] Prompt variables/templates
- [ ] Batch testing with datasets
- [ ] Evaluation metrics

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**:
- [ ] AI optimization suggestions
- [ ] Version diffing
- [ ] Cost optimization dashboard
- [ ] Team collaboration features

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**:
- [ ] AI test case generator
- [ ] Regression testing
- [ ] Security scanner
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Key Metrics

**Pricing**:
- Individual: $5/month ‚Üí 200 credits
- Org Member: $2/month ‚Üí 200 credits (60% discount)
- Org Verification: $99/month

**Value Proposition**:
- 2x more credits than $5 small pack
- Better per-credit cost than any one-time purchase
- Rollover up to 200 credits (never waste)

**Competitive Advantages**:
1. **Package-based prompts** - Test community prompts instantly (UNIQUE)
2. **Version comparison** - See which prompt version performs better (RARE)
3. **Organization pricing** - Subsidized team access (COMPETITIVE)
4. **Public analytics** - See what works before testing (UNIQUE)
