## Defensive Moats

### What Protects PRPM Long-Term

#### 1. **Network Effects** (Strong)

```
More prompts → More users → More testing → Better data → More users
```

**Like GitHub**:
- Once prompts are on PRPM, they promote PRPM
- Data moat grows with usage
- Hard to replicate community

#### 2. **Data Moat** (Growing)

**Proprietary data**:
- Which prompts work for which tasks
- Which models perform best
- Version performance deltas
- Community ratings at scale

**Nobody else has**:
- Public package performance data
- Cross-version comparisons
- Community validation scores

#### 3. **Format Compatibility** (Technical Moat)

**Your converters** are a huge advantage:
- Test Cursor rules → Convert → Test on any model
- Test Claude projects → Export to any format
- Universal translator for prompts

**Enables**:
- "Test anywhere" strategy
- Lock-in through convenience
- Unique import/export flows

#### 4. **Community Lock-In** (Social Moat)

Once users:
- Publish prompts on PRPM
- Build reputation scores
- Accumulate testing data
- Share within teams

**Switching cost is high**:
- Lose public analytics
- Lose community following
- Lose version history
- Lose team data

---

## Threats to Watch

### 1. **Free Tier Expansion**

**Threat**: The Prompt Index adds prompt library

**Defense**:
- We have better UX
- Better analytics
- Better organization
- Community curation
- $5 is worth the quality

### 2. **Enterprise Incumbents**

**Threat**: Vellum adds free tier or community features

**Defense**:
- We're community-first (they're not)
- Simpler, faster product
- Already cheaper
- Better for individuals
- Network effects in our favor

### 3. **AI Companies Themselves**

**Threat**: OpenAI/Anthropic add prompt sharing to playgrounds

**Defense**:
- Multi-model support (we're agnostic)
- Format conversion (universal)
- Community already established
- Analytics advantage
- Better discovery

### 4. **Open Source Competition**

**Threat**: Agenta gets easy hosting, goes viral

**Defense**:
- We're already hosted (easier)
- Community library advantage
- Public analytics (unique)
- Better for non-technical users
- Org features for teams

## Win/Loss Analysis

### When We Win

✅ **Individual developer needs simple testing**
✅ **Team wants to share prompts internally**
✅ **Organization needs analytics for ROI**
✅ **User values community validation**
✅ **Budget conscious** (<$100/month)

### When We Lose

❌ **Enterprise needs complex CI/CD**
❌ **Already using Vellum/Langfuse** (switching cost)
❌ **Needs production deployment**
❌ **Requires on-premise** (security)
❌ **Wants 100% free forever**

### How to Convert Losses to Wins

**Complex CI/CD** → Build API, CLI (Months 9-12)
**Switching cost** → Import tools, migration guide
**Production** → Partner with deployment tools
**On-premise** → Enterprise tier (Month 12+)
**Free forever** → Show ROI value, maintain free tier for discovery
