// AI generates test cases:
Test Case 1: Simple valid code
Input: "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }"
Expected: ✅ Positive feedback, no issues

Test Case 2: Code with bug
Input: "function divide(a, b) { return a / b; }"
Expected: ⚠️ Should warn about division by zero

Test Case 3: Security issue
Input: "eval(userInput)"
Expected: 🚨 Should flag security vulnerability

Test Case 4: Edge case
Input: "" (empty code)
Expected: Should handle gracefully
