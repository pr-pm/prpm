## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Failed to fetch credits"
**Cause**: Backend not running or wrong URL
**Fix**:
```bash
# Check backend is running
cd packages/registry && npm run dev

# Check NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_URL in webapp/.env
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3111" > packages/webapp/.env.local
```

### Issue: "Not authenticated" redirect loop
**Cause**: JWT token expired or invalid
**Fix**:
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
localStorage.removeItem('jwt_token')
// Then login again
```

### Issue: "Package not found"
**Cause**: No packages in database
**Fix**:
```bash
# Publish a test package
cd packages/cli
prpm publish
```

### Issue: Modal doesn't close after purchase
**Cause**: Expected behavior in dev (no Stripe integration)
**Fix**: Click the X button to close manually

### Issue: Estimated credits not showing
**Cause**: Need to type at least 10 characters
**Fix**: Type more text in input field

## üìä Test Data Setup

### Create Test User
```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123"}'

# Get JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123"}'
```

### Add Credits Manually (If Needed)
```sql
-- Via PostgreSQL
UPDATE playground_credits
SET purchased_credits = purchased_credits + 100,
    balance = balance + 100
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com');
```

### Create PRPM+ User (For Testing Monthly Credits)
```sql
-- Via PostgreSQL
-- First, create an organization
INSERT INTO organizations (id, name, is_verified)
VALUES (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Test Org', true);

-- Add user to verified org
INSERT INTO organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role)
SELECT o.id, u.id, 'admin'
FROM organizations o, users u
WHERE o.name = 'Test Org' AND u.email = 'test@example.com';

-- Grant monthly credits
UPDATE playground_credits
SET monthly_credits = 200,
