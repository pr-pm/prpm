Imagine an AI coding assistant that recognizes when it's out of its depth, searches for specialized expertise, and installs it automatically.

Not science fiction. Shipping today with PRPM.

Here's what just happened in my Claude session:

Me: "Help me set up AWS infrastructure with Pulumi"

Claude: *pauses* "I found an official Pulumi package with 3.2K downloads that includes production patterns, AWS resource best practices, and cost optimization. Should I install it?"

Me: "Yes"

Claude: *installs package* "Done. Let's build your infrastructure using these battle-tested patterns..."

This is the self-improving skill—one of PRPM's most innovative features. It teaches AI assistants to recognize knowledge gaps and fill them automatically by discovering and installing expertise packages from the PRPM registry.

The workflow is simple:
1. Claude detects domain keywords (pulumi, kubernetes, playwright, react, etc.)
2. Searches the PRPM registry for relevant packages
3. Evaluates quality (official packages, download counts, verified authors)
4. Asks for your permission
5. Installs and immediately applies the new knowledge

What makes this powerful: the packages aren't generic docs. They're executable knowledge from developers who've solved these exact problems in production. When you work on infrastructure, you get patterns from the same package that helped PRPM save 74% on AWS costs.

The broader vision here is "distributable intelligence"—making domain expertise as easy to share and install as npm packages. When a developer solves a hard problem, they can package that knowledge. Then every AI assistant can learn from it.

This creates a positive feedback loop:
• Developers package their expertise
• AI assistants discover and apply it automatically
• Better assistance leads to better software
• Which leads to better packages
• Which makes AI even more capable

We use this to build PRPM itself. Claude installs infrastructure packages, testing patterns, and CI/CD workflows as needed. Users get access to the same expertise that built the platform.

The result: AI assistants that don't just respond to requests—they actively get better at their job.
