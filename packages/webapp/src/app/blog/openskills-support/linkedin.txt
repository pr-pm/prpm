Today PRPM adds native OpenSkills format support. This took less than 1 day to implement—showing how PRPM's architecture makes it easy to support new formats.

The Problem:
AI coding tools are fragmented. Cursor, Claude Code, Continue, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot all use different formats for prompts and skills. This creates duplication, vendor lock-in, and makes sharing hard.

The Solution:
OpenSkills launched Oct 26 as a universal skills loader—one format that works across multiple AI coding platforms. It gained 629 stars in 2 days, signaling strong demand for universal formats.

PRPM now bridges these ecosystems with automatic format conversion.

What This Means:

Publish Once, Install Anywhere
Write a skill in OpenSkills format, publish to PRPM, users install in their preferred format (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, etc.)

Centralized Discovery
OpenSkills uses GitHub for distribution. PRPM adds a centralized registry with search, categories, analytics, and versioning.

How PRPM's Architecture Made This Fast:

At the core of PRPM is a canonical format—a universal representation for all prompts, skills, and agents. Every format just needs two functions: to/from canonical.

This means we don't need N×N converters. Just N converters total. Adding OpenSkills required just:
- fromOpenSkills() - Parse SKILL.md to canonical
- toOpenSkills() - Convert canonical to SKILL.md

Once those exist, OpenSkills packages can instantly convert to all 8 other formats PRPM supports.

Technical Quality:
- 11/11 tests passing
- Robust YAML parsing with js-yaml (8.7M weekly downloads)
- Conversion quality scoring (95-100% for most content)
- Graceful degradation for edge cases
- Server-side caching with Redis

This is Infrastructure:

PRPM isn't just another package registry. It's infrastructure for the AI coding ecosystem—like npm, cargo, and pip.

The architecture decisions (canonical format, converter pattern, quality scoring, caching) mean:
- Adding new formats takes hours, not weeks
- Quality is consistent across all converters
- Users get choice—publish once, install anywhere
- Ecosystem grows together

Why This Matters:

Network Effects: OpenSkills community + PRPM community = stronger ecosystem for everyone

Reduces Fragmentation: One package, many formats. No more rewriting the same skill for different tools.

Future-Proof: As new AI coding tools emerge, they'll likely support OpenSkills or other established formats. PRPM can add support quickly.

Try it today:

npm install -g prpm
prpm install @user/python-expert --as openskills
