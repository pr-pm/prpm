🎓 Excited to announce: PRPM now supports OpenSkills!

The Problem:
AI coding tools are fragmented—Cursor, Claude Code, Continue, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot all use different formats for prompts and skills. This creates duplication, vendor lock-in, and makes sharing hard.

The Solution:
OpenSkills (https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) launched Oct 26 as a universal skills loader—one format that works across multiple AI coding platforms. It gained 629 stars in 2 days, signaling strong demand.

Today, PRPM adds native OpenSkills support with automatic format conversion.

What This Means:

✅ Publish Once, Install Anywhere
Write a skill in OpenSkills format → publish to PRPM → users install in their preferred format (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, etc.)

✅ Centralized Discovery
OpenSkills uses GitHub for distribution. PRPM adds a centralized registry with search, categories, analytics, and versioning.

✅ Robust YAML Parsing
We implemented js-yaml for parsing complex frontmatter—handling multiline strings, arrays, nested objects, and gracefully handling errors.

Technical Highlights:

• 11/11 tests passing
• Conversion quality scoring (transparent about lossy conversions)
• Installs to .claude/skills/{package-name}/SKILL.md
• Consistent with other PRPM converters (agents.md, Kiro, Copilot)

Example Usage:

```bash
# Install in OpenSkills format
prpm install @user/python-expert --as openskills

# Or auto-convert to your preferred format
prpm install @user/python-expert --as cursor
prpm install @user/python-expert --as claude
```

Why This Matters:

1. Network Effects
OpenSkills community + PRPM community = stronger ecosystem for everyone

2. Universal Package Manager
PRPM now supports 9 formats: Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, agents.md, OpenSkills, and generic

3. Reduces Fragmentation
One package, many formats. No more rewriting the same skill for different tools.

What's Next:

→ Bundled resources support (references/, scripts/, assets/)
→ Cross-promotion with OpenSkills creator
→ Example repository showcasing real-world skills

Huge thanks to the OpenSkills creator (@numman-ali on GitHub) for building this universal format. We're excited to support it in PRPM.
