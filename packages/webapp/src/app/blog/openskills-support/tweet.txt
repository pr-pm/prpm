🎓 PRPM now supports OpenSkills!

OpenSkills is a universal skills loader for AI coding agents that launched Oct 26 with 629 stars in 2 days.

Now you can:
✅ Publish OpenSkills to PRPM's registry
✅ Install with auto-conversion to Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf
✅ Parse complex YAML with js-yaml

Why this matters:
→ Reduces ecosystem fragmentation
→ Network effects (OpenSkills + PRPM communities)
→ Universal package manager positioning

Example:
```
prpm install @user/python-expert --as openskills
# → Installs to .claude/skills/python-expert/SKILL.md

prpm install @user/python-expert --as cursor
# → Auto-converts and installs to .cursor/rules/
```

Technical highlights:
• Robust YAML parsing (handles multiline, arrays, nested objects)
• 11/11 tests passing
• Graceful error handling
• Conversion quality scoring (95-100% for most content)
