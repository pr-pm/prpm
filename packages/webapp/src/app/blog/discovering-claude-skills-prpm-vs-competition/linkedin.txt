Want to add a code review skill to Claude? You've got options: ctx.directory for browsing creators, SkillsMP for marketplace search, GitHub for raw files, or Twitter for recommendations.

Each platform has its own discovery mechanism, format, and installation process. No unified search. No version control. No way to test before installing. You're manually copying markdown files into .claude/skills/ and hoping they work.

It's 2025, and we're installing AI packages like it's 1995.

PRPM brings package management to AI coding tools. Install Claude skills with a single CLI command, test them in a playground before installing, get automatic format conversion if you switch editors, and receive updates just like npm packages.

Real example: Setting up code review skills takes 10-15 minutes with manual copy-paste from marketplaces. With PRPM, it's one command (prpm install @code-and-craft/code-reviewer) and takes 30 seconds.

The difference:
• ctx.directory: Great for browsing creators, but manual installation
• SkillsMP: Searchable marketplace, but still manual downloads
• PRPM: CLI installation, version control, testing playground, format conversion

We compared all three platforms in detail, including feature tables and real workflow examples. If you're using Claude Desktop or Claude Code, this guide will save you hours.
