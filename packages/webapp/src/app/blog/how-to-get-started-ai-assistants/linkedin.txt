Your team sees you shipping features in hours that used to take days. They ask: "How do I get started with AI assistants?"

You send them documentation. Setup guides. Tutorial videos. A week later, nothing's changed. They're still stuck at the starting line.

Here's the problem: Most guides teach you ABOUT AI assistants. You spend hours learning concepts before seeing any value. That's backwards.

The fastest way to learn is to see immediate results, then understand why they work. So here's a different approach—get value in the next 5 minutes:

1. Install @sanjeed5/react → Get production-ready React components with TypeScript types, accessibility, and error handling built in. 30 seconds vs 30 minutes of manual work.

2. Install @prpm/thoroughness → Make your AI actually think through bugs systematically instead of guessing random fixes. First suggestion usually works.

3. Install @prpm/typescript-type-safety → Stop your AI from writing 'any' types and lazy shortcuts. Catch bugs before code review.

Total time: 5 minutes to install 3 packages and try 3 examples.
Total value: Your AI assistant just got 5 years of experience.

This is how onboarding should work. No ecosystem overviews. No theory. Just: install, try, see the difference.

Once you see the value, you'll naturally want to dig deeper. But first, get one win.
