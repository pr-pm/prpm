Package managers fundamentally changed how we ship code. npm, pip, cargo—they made it trivial to install and share libraries across projects.

But there's been no equivalent for AI instructions. Every team writes their own Cursor rules, Claude skills, and Copilot instructions from scratch. Copy-paste between projects. Reinvent patterns that dozens of other teams have already solved.

Today, we're launching PRPM (Prompt Package Manager)—a universal registry for AI prompts, agents, skills, and rules that work across Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, and any future AI editor.

Instead of copy-pasting .cursorrules files between projects, you can:
• Install curated packages: prpm install @nextjs/app-router
• Publish your own patterns for others to use
• Get automatic format conversion for your specific AI editor
• Browse 7,000+ packages from the community

We built the infrastructure we wanted to exist: format-agnostic, privacy-first, and as reliable as npm.
