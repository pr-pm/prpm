GitHub Copilot's custom instructions let you shape AI behavior for your codebase. But finding quality instructions is a scattered mess.

You search Gists for "copilot instructions react." Browse GitHub repos hoping they have .github/copilot-instructions.md files you can copy. Check Reddit threads. Read blog posts with examples buried in prose. Copy-paste text, fix formatting issues, hope it works.

No unified search. No quality vetting. No versioning. No way to test before using. It's like package management before npm existed.

PRPM changes this. We built a centralized marketplace for Copilot instructions with full package management: CLI installation, semantic versioning, testing playground, quality metrics, and format conversion.

Real example: Setting up Copilot for a React + TypeScript project used to take 20-30 minutes of searching and manual copying. With PRPM: prpm install @prpm/copilot-react-ts. Takes 30 seconds, includes tested instructions for React hooks, TypeScript strict mode, and testing best practices.

The difference:
• Before: Search Gists/GitHub/Reddit, copy-paste, manually merge, hope for the best
• After: prpm search --format copilot, test in playground, install with one command, get automatic updates

PRPM also converts formats. Found great Copilot instructions but your team uses Cursor? Add --format cursor. Same package, different editor. Cross-editor compatibility means you're never locked in.

We wrote a detailed comparison with real workflows, feature tables, and quick start guides. If you use GitHub Copilot or manage AI instructions for your team, this will save you significant time.
