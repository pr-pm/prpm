Windsurf is new. Its ecosystem is just forming. Early adopters are creating rules, sharing setups on Twitter, publishing to GitHub repos. But there's no centralized marketplace yet.

We've seen this story before with Cursor, Claude, and GitHub Copilot:

1. Tool launches with custom rule support
2. Users share on Twitter/Reddit, create GitHub repos
3. Discovery becomes harder as ecosystem grows
4. Knowledge fragments across dozens of sources
5. Someone eventually builds a marketplace
6. But by then, scattered knowledge is hard to consolidate

Windsurf has a chance to skip this entire fragmentation phase. PRPM is ready now, offering centralized discovery from day one.

Why this matters: Centralized package management isn't just convenient—it shapes how an ecosystem develops. When good rules have a home, they get found. Quality rises via ratings. Standards emerge naturally. The community grows faster.

Real example: Setting up Windsurf for a React project currently takes 20-30 minutes of GitHub hunting and manual file copying. With PRPM: prpm install @prpm/windsurf-react. Takes 30 seconds.

PRPM offers Windsurf users:
• CLI installation (prpm install @package --format windsurf)
• Centralized search across all published rules
• Version control with semantic versioning
• Testing playground before installation
• Format conversion (install Cursor rules as Windsurf format)
• Quality metrics from day one

For early adopters: This is your chance to shape the ecosystem. Publish packages, establish standards, reach the entire community from one place.

For the community: Avoid the fragmentation that plagued other tools. Start with centralized discovery, benefit from network effects earlier.

Being early has compounding benefits. When Cursor launched, rules were scattered for years before cursor.directory emerged. Windsurf can skip that phase entirely.
