You've probably wasted hours searching GitHub for cursor rules that actually work.

We analyzed over 1,000 cursor rules in the PRPM registry to save you the trouble. These aren't just popular packages—they're comprehensive, battle-tested, and cover everything from Next.js to Kubernetes.

What makes this different: we evaluated based on verification status, real download counts, comprehensiveness (structure + performance + security + testing), and author reputation. No fluff, just rules that solve real problems.

The breakdown:
• 5 meta packages (including creating your own cursor rules)
• 10 frontend framework packages (React, Next.js, Vue, tRPC)
• 7 TypeScript/JavaScript packages (most downloaded: @lst97/typescript-pro)
• 10 backend language packages (Python, Go, Rust, Swift)
• 8 quality/testing/security packages (code review, pen testing, automation)
• 3 DevOps packages (Kubernetes specialists)
• 2 ML/AI packages (PyTorch, machine learning)

But here's what makes PRPM powerful: you're not limited to packages originally built for Cursor. Every package in our registry—over 1,000 Claude skills, agents, and prompts—can be converted to Cursor rules with one command.

Search for "testing" and you'll see every testing-related package across all AI editors. Install any of them, and PRPM converts it to Cursor's format automatically. That's 10x more options than browsing cursor-specific packages alone.

Key insights from analyzing 1,000+ packages:
1. Quality correlates with author reputation (@prpm, @voltagent, @lst97, @sanjeed5)
2. Comprehensive rules beat narrow ones (structure + performance + security + testing)
3. Security and testing packages are rising fast
4. Framework-specific depth wins (use the most specific rule for your stack)

Installation takes seconds:
npm install -g prpm

Install our starter set with one command:
prpm install @lst97/typescript-pro @voltagent/nextjs-developer @voltagent/code-reviewer @prpm/creating-cursor-rules @voltagent/security-auditor

This gives you: type safety, modern web apps, quality checks, the ability to create your own rules, and security auditing—everything you need to get started.
