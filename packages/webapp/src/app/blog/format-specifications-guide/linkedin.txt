Each AI IDE has its own format for prompts and rules. Cursor requires YAML frontmatter with a description field. Windsurf forbids frontmatter entirely and limits content to 12k characters. Claude Code needs name + description and supports tool restrictions. Continue uses regex matching with tri-state inclusion logic.

It's a mess.

We've reverse-engineered and documented all 8 major AI IDE formats with complete JSON schemas that power PRPM's conversion system:

• Cursor (.cursor/rules) - 4 rule types, MDC format, intelligent selection
• Claude Code (.claude/{agents,skills,commands}/) - allowed-tools, model selection, executable hooks
• Continue (.continue/rules/*.md) - globs, regex, complex alwaysApply logic
• Windsurf (.windsurf/rules) - plain markdown, zero config, 12k hard limit
• GitHub Copilot (.github/copilot-instructions.md) - two-tier system, comma-separated patterns
• Kiro Steering (.kiro/steering/*.md) - inclusion modes, foundational types, domain organization
• Kiro Hooks (.kiro/hooks/*.json) - event-driven file automations
• agents.md (project root) - OpenAI's standard, maximum simplicity

Every schema is published on GitHub. You can validate your prompts programmatically, understand exactly what each format supports, and convert between formats without losing metadata.

This is the infrastructure that makes PRPM's format-agnostic registry possible. Install a Cursor rule as a Claude skill, a Windsurf rule as a Copilot instruction, or any format to any other format.
