Claude Code offers both skills and sub-agents. Most developers don't know when to use which—and picking wrong breaks your workflow.

Here's what I learned after analyzing both and testing with real projects:

Skills are prompt templates that inject specialized instructions into Claude's context. Think of them as reference cards Claude pulls out when relevant. They're model-invoked (Claude decides when), lightweight (under 2K tokens), and perfect for patterns that apply across many situations.

Use skills for:
• Coding conventions (TypeScript patterns, naming rules)
• Framework-specific knowledge (Next.js App Router gotchas)
• Domain glossaries (fintech terms, medical vocabulary)
• Testing standards that apply everywhere

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that run in isolated context windows. They have full tool access, maintain their own state, and complete complex multi-step tasks autonomously.

Use sub-agents for:
• Security audits across multiple files
• Large-scale refactoring with coordination
• Architecture analysis and documentation
• Any complex task requiring systematic execution

The mistake most developers make: trying to use skills for execution (they can't—they're guidance only) or using sub-agents for simple patterns (waste of context window).

Real example: We tried using a skill for code review. It failed—skills can't analyze multiple files systematically. Switched to a sub-agent. Worked perfectly. Found 3 critical security issues in authentication that would've reached production.

PRPM packages both skills and sub-agents. Same format, same install command, automatic format conversion across editors. Browse 4,000+ packages at registry.prpm.dev.
