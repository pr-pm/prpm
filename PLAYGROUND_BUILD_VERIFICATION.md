## 💰 Business Model Verification

### Pricing Tiers
| Tier | Price | Credits | Margin |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **PRPM+ Monthly** | $20/mo | 200 | ~70-75% |
| **Small Pack** | $5 | 100 | 50% |
| **Medium Pack** | $10 | 250 | 60% |
| **Large Pack** | $20 | 600 | 67% |

### Credit Costs
| Run Type | Credits | Estimated Tokens | Anthropic Cost | Revenue | Margin |
|----------|---------|------------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| **Basic** | 1 | ~2,000 | $0.012 | $0.10 | 88% |
| **Medium** | 2 | ~5,000 | $0.030 | $0.20 | 85% |
| **Large** | 3 | ~10,000 | $0.060 | $0.30 | 80% |

*Note: Margins calculated at $0.10 per credit revenue ($20/200 credits)*

### Cost Control
- ✅ Monthly limits (200 credits = max $12 API cost)
- ✅ Credit-based pricing prevents runaway costs
- ✅ User sees credit cost before running
- ✅ Insufficient credits returns 402 error
- ✅ Break-even at ~833 runs/month per PRPM+ user

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why Credits-Based?
- **Transparent pricing**: Users know exactly what they're spending
- **Cost control**: Hard limits prevent unexpected API bills
- **Flexible purchasing**: Buy more if needed
- **Fair usage**: Heavy users pay more, light users pay less

### Why Priority Spending Order?
1. **Monthly credits first**: Use subscription benefits
2. **Rollover credits second**: Use before expiration
3. **Purchased credits last**: Never expire, save for later
- **Result**: Maximizes user value, encourages purchases

### Why Rollover System?
- **Prevents waste**: Unused monthly credits don't disappear
- **Limited to 1 month**: Prevents hoarding
- **Encourages engagement**: Users log in monthly to use credits
- **Business value**: Increases stickiness

### Why Atomic Transactions?
- **Race condition safety**: Multiple concurrent requests handled correctly
- **Data integrity**: Balance always matches sum of parts
- **Audit trail**: Every credit change logged
- **Rollback support**: Failures don't corrupt data

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

### Non-Blocking
- ⏳ Currently uses `snippet` field, should extract from tarball
  - PR #6 helps with this (Lambda extraction fix)
  - Not blocking MVP - snippet works for testing
- ⏳ No rate limiting yet
  - Add before production launch
  - Fastify rate-limit plugin already installed
- ⏳ No content moderation for shared sessions
  - Future enhancement
  - Monitor for abuse

### Future Enhancements
- ⏳ Streaming responses (WebSocket)
- ⏳ Model selection UI (Sonnet vs Opus)
- ⏳ Temperature controls
- ⏳ Monaco editor for code generation
- ⏳ A/B testing mode (compare prompts)
- ⏳ Team credit pools
- ⏳ Usage analytics dashboard

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
